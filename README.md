# Python-learning-notes
# I have finished four weeks'(3 hours each) python tutorial last year.
# This year I am learning OO in a 2 week course and I found that I forgot
# nearly all the data structures and algorithms I knew. So, it might be
# a good idea to review and take a notes in spare time.

# So far, I just review by reading wikipedia and recalling what I knew.
# Hopefully, I could do experiment on my code conveniently and read books
# if I have time after I finished my homework on physics T_T.
