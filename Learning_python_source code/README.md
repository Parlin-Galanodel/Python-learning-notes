# notes on reading python source code

I met many strange problems especially in Ipython environment due to lack of 
knowledge on how python works.

I decide to read python source code to understand some internal mechanism of 
the implementation of Cpython.

Ah, gosh, this is so hard and I am driven crazy by tons of pointers in python
source code. I think I'd better finish algorithm & data structures first because 
not enough time left after math and physics.
