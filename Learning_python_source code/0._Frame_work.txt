Cpython implemented by C. I hope I remember enough knowledge on C programming 
to understand python source code.

The python code I used is Python 2.7.9rc1, released in 2014-11-26. New version!
I'd like to read Objects part firstly and then parser.

Python implementation is composed by three main part:
	1. the file groups
	2. core python VM/interpreter
	3. runtime interface/environment

  File groups include the core modules, installed libraries and user defined modules.

  Runtime interface include memory allocator, object/type structures.

  Core python VM is a virtual machine which run python code by parsing and compiling
  it into python byte code.
